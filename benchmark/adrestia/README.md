Adrestia - Goddess of revolt, just retribution and sublime balance
between good and evil - "She who cannot be escaped".

Each of the tests is specifically designed to trigger a code path in
the Linux kernel. Unlike most other benchmarks/performance tests,
their purpose is not to simulate a real-life workload.
